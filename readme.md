# RAG Document Server API

This API provides a backend for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, allowing you to upload documents, search their content, and ask questions using an LLM (Large Language Model) powered by the retrieved information.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The server initializes two core services on startup:
* **Elasticsearch**: Used as a fast, scalable search index for storing and retrieving document content. The API waits for Elasticsearch to be available before starting.
* **OpenAI LLM**: The `OpenAI` model is used for generating answers based on retrieved context. This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.

## ðŸ“‹ API Endpoints

### Health Check

`GET /health`

This endpoint provides a detailed health status of the server and its dependencies. It's useful for monitoring the system's operational status.
